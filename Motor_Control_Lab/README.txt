Hello Prof. Larson,

The instructions on this program is to launch putty in a mode such that 
characters are immediately streamed to the embedded device ie. without pressing 'Enter'.

This will give it the best effect.

Press and hold 'U' to speed the motor forward
Press and hold 'J' to slow the motor down and put it in reverse
Press and hold 'U' again to slow the motor down until it starts moving forward again
Press 'R' to reverse the motor from its current direction
Press 'S' to stop the motor in it's place
